This is the repository for exercises and assignments.

We provide two different notebook versions in separate folders, one for *Jupyter Lab* users and one for *VSCode* users 
(also supports PyCharm, Dataspell, and other editors). We recommend that you use *Jupyter Lab* because it provides 
notebooks that look similar to the webpage. However, the *VSCode* notebooks contain the exact same text but without the 
formatting.

Each folder contains sub-folders that mirror the webpage urls. For example, the first exercise is placed in 
`02-material/W1-introduction/`.
