Please carefully follow the guidelines provided. We strongly advise against installing newer versions of software packages, even if they are available, as doing so may result in an unstable installation.“ \n","_Anaconda_ is used to manage\n","packages and environments.\n","## Installation\n","\n","---\n","**Task 1 (easy): Download Anaconda**\n","Go to the [anaconda webpage](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)\n","\n","and download the installer for `Python 3.9`\n",". IML uses version `3.9`\n"," to ensure a stable installation.\n","Notice, Windows users need to manually install a few libraries and use the terminal for installing Anaconda. Detailed installation guides can be found for all platforms (but is particularly useful for Linux users) [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)\n",".\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Tip**\n","Windows users should check the _use Anaconda as default Python_\n","checkbox when prompted.\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","**Task 2 (easy): Prepare Anaconda**\n","1. On macOS and Linux, open a terminal. On Windows, open the _Anaconda\n","Prompt_ application.\n","\n","2. Navigate to this week’s folder of the downloaded [exercise repository](https://github.itu.dk/IML/iml_student2023)\n",".\n","\n","3. Execute the command\n","``` #4\n","conda env create -f iml_env.yml\n","\n","```\n","\n","This creates a new environment called _iml_ and automatically\n","install the necessary packages used during the course, including\n","`OpenCV`\n",", `Numpy`\n",", `Pytorch`\n",", etc.\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","## Using Anaconda\n","Anaconda allows easy switching between environments each which may contain different versions of Python and packages. Although we only use a single environment for IML, you may want to create your own custom environments. This ensures that you do not accidentally invalidate other projects by, for example,\n","updating a package with breaking API changes.\n","In order to use the environments, they need to be activated. To activate an environment, use the following command:\n","``` #8\n","conda activate <env-name>\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","**Tip**\n","The name of the active environment is shown in the terminal to the left of the usual prompt.\n","\n","\n","We have listed a number of commonly used Anaconda commands here:\n","**Lists installed packages and versions in the current environment:**\n","``` #10\n","conda list\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Install the specified package using Anaconda:**\n","``` #11\n","conda install <package>\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Remove the specified package:**\n","``` #12\n","conda uninstall <package>\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Create new environment with specified name and python version:**\n","``` #13\n","conda env create -n <name> python=<version>\n","\n","```\n","\n","**Update specific package or all package in currently active environment:**\n","``` #15\n","conda update <package/--all>\n","\n","```\n","\n","Additional information can be found using `conda --help`\n",", `conda <command> --help`\n",", or [the official Anaconda\n","documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)\n",".\n","## Setting the default environment\n","Activating the same environment every time you open a terminal can become tiresome. You can easily set up a default environment to automatically activate upon opening a terminal\n","\n","---\n","**Task 3 (easy): Setting default environment**\n","**For Windows users:**\n","1. Open the file `Activate.bat`\n","\n","in `C:\\Users\\<YourUserName>\\AppData\\Local\\Continuum\\anaconda3\\Scripts`\n",". If \n","it isn’t there, try searching for the file `Activate.bat`\n",".\n","\n","2. Add  `conda activate iml`\n"," to the end of the file: `conda activate iml`\n",".\n","\n","3. Test that the environment is automatically activated by opening a \n","new anaconda prompt (find the app in the start menu).\n","\n","\n","**For macOS and Linux users:**\n","1. Open the `~/.bashrc`\n"," file (or equivalent if you are using another shell).\n","\n","2. Add the line `conda activate iml`\n"," to the end of the file.\n","\n","3. Open a new terminal and check that the environment is \n","activated (the prompt should be preceded by `(iml)`\n",")\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","### Editors and workflow\n","During the course, you may either want to use Python directly from the terminal using a text editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n"," or [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/)\n",", or indirectly from an IDE such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)\n"," or [Wing](https://wingware.com/)\n",". These editors are either free or have free editions for students. We recommend you to start with one of these as they make debugging significantly easier (Visual Studio Code also has very capable Python debugging support but requires a bit more setup) @Anton… hvorfor er det sværere i VSCODE??.\n","#### Jupyter Lab\n","Jupyter Lab will be used for some of the exercises. Jupyter Lab is a web-based IDE for developing interactive scripts in notebook format, making it possible to intertwine _markdown_-based text with code and visual output.  Jupyter Lab has some l main drawback is its inability to show GUI elements from OpenCV (@Anton… men det bruger vi jo ikke mere kan det så ikke slettes). The course will primarily use it to introduce  theoretical concepts as well as initial data exploration.\n","To start Jupyter Lab, either run `jupyter lab`\n"," from the terminal (remember to activate the _iml_ environment typing `conda activate iml`\n",") in a terminal or use the _Anaconda Navigator_ application.\n","### Workflows\n","\n","---\n","**Task 4 (easy): Editor workflow**\n","This exercise aims to introduce you to a basic workflow using OpenCV and\n","Python with either a text editor and terminal, or using the Jupyter Lab\n","environment.\n","1.
