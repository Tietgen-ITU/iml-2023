        "# Descriptive Statistics and Handling Missing Data in Pose Data Sequences\n",
        "This exercise delves into the exploration of descriptive statistics and methodologies for managing missing data, particularly within a slightly intricate dataset comprising fixed-length skeleton data sequences. Moreover, it encompasses the evaluation of the efficacy of these methodologies.\n",
        "The primary objective is to implement and scrutinize various techniques for managing absent data points, ensuring a comprehensive and unblemished dataset for subsequent analyses.\n",
        "### Pose Data Overview\n",
        "In the subsequent cell, the ground truth dataset is loaded alongside an identical yet noise-infused counterpart. This involves a 30-frame time series sequence, capturing human poses with each frame encompassing 25_2 features, namely the x and y coordinates for 25 skeletal joints. We'll generate 200 such sequences, forming a dataset with a shape of ( (200, 30, 25_2) ).\n",
        "#### Handling Missing Values\n",
        "From the ground truth dataset (`GT_poses`\n",
        "), data has been intentionally omitted, thereby creating the `Noisy_poses`\n",
        " dataset wherein 30% of the original values have been randomly substituted with NaN values (`np.nan`\n",
        "). The ensuing step involves implementing and evaluating varied strategies for dealing with these missing data points, ensuring the robustness of the eventual analyses derived from this dataset.\n",
